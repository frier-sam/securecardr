# SecureCardr - Zero-Knowledge Card Vault Web App
## Project Plan & Task Tracker

### Project Overview
Build a single-page web application that lets users securely store, organize, and retrieve arbitrary "cards" (credit, debit, ID, loyalty, membership, etc.) by typing in details or snapping a photo—all encrypted client-side and saved directly to the user's own Google Drive folder.

**Core Principle**: Zero-knowledge architecture - we never see or touch unencrypted data; the user owns and controls everything.

## Project Structure & Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Tailwind
- **State Management**: React Context + useState/useReducer

### Authentication & Storage
- **Auth**: Firebase Authentication (Google provider)
- **Storage**: Google Drive REST API (drive.file scope)
- **Metadata**: Optional Firestore (only folder IDs, never card content)

### Security & Encryption
- **Encryption**: Web Crypto API (AES-GCM + PBKDF2/HKDF)
- **Principle**: Client-side encryption only, zero server-side key storage

### Additional Libraries
- **Image Processing**: Cropper.js
- **OCR**: Tesseract.js
- **File Handling**: Custom utilities for Drive API
