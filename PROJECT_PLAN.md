# SecureCardr - Zero-Knowledge Card Vault Web App
## Project Plan & Task Tracker

### Project Overview
Build a single-page web application that lets users securely store, organize, and retrieve arbitrary "cards" (credit, debit, ID, loyalty, membership, etc.) by typing in details or snapping a photo—all encrypted client-side and saved directly to the user's own Google Drive folder.

**Core Principle**: Zero-knowledge architecture - we never see or touch unencrypted data; the user owns and controls everything.

## Project Structure & Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Tailwind
- **State Management**: React Context + useState/useReducer

### Authentication & Storage

  - Visual strength meter with color coding and feedback
  - Secure passphrase generator with word combinations
  - Integration with existing PassphraseSetupModal workflow
  - Proper TypeScript interfaces and security practices
- **Status**: ✅ Complete - Component created and ready for use

### Bug Fixes - UI/UX Improvements ✅
**Issues Resolved**: Three critical user experience issues
- **Issue 1 - Image Crop Button**: 
  - **Problem**: "Apply Crop" button was not visible or accessible in the image cropper
  - **Solution**: Fixed button styling with better contrast (`bg-primary` instead of `bg-primary-600`), added shadow, and improved mobile layout
  - **Files Updated**: `ImageCropper.tsx`
  
- **Issue 2 - Vault Session Persistence**:
  - **Problem**: Vault password needed to be re-entered after every page refresh
  - **Solution**: Implemented `VaultSessionManager` service with:
    - Secure session storage using sessionStorage
    - 5-minute automatic timeout with extension on activity
    - Session encryption with temporary session keys
    - Automatic session checking on app load
  - **Files Created**: `vaultSession.ts`
  - **Files Updated**: `App.tsx`, `AuthContext.tsx`
  
- **Issue 3 - Loading Experience**:
  - **Problem**: Screen appeared frozen for several seconds when entering vault password
  - **Solution**: 
    - Implemented optimized parallel card loading with `Promise.all`
    - Added proper loading overlay component with visual feedback
    - Removed inline loading states from Dashboard
    - Added progress indication during decryption
  - **Files Updated**: `App.tsx`
  
- **Status**: ✅ Complete - All three issues resolved
- **Security**: All fixes maintain zero-knowledge architecture principles

### Bug Fixes - Image Workflow and Card Validation ✅
**Issues Resolved**: Two UX improvements
- **Issue 1 - Simplified Image Workflow**:
  - **Problem**: 
    - "Save Enhanced Image" button error: `onSave is not a function`
    - Too many complex steps (capture, crop, enhance, OCR, validate)
    - User wanted simple crop-only functionality
  - **Solution**: 
    - Simplified ImageWorkflow to only have capture and crop steps
    - Removed ImageEditor, OCR, and validation steps entirely
    - Cleaned up UI to be minimal and focused
    - Fixed function prop mismatches
  - **Files Updated**: `ImageWorkflow.tsx`, `CardForm.tsx`
  
- **Issue 2 - Card Number Validation**:
  - **Problem**: Card number validation was too strict for loyalty, ID, and other non-payment cards
  - **Solution**: 
    - Made card number validation conditional based on card category
    - Only apply Luhn algorithm and strict length checks for credit/debit cards
    - For other card types, only basic length validation (max 50 chars)
    - Card number is only required for credit/debit cards
  - **Files Updated**: `cardValidation.ts`, `CardForm.tsx`
  
- **Status**: ✅ Complete - Both issues resolved
- **User Experience**: Simplified workflow and smarter validation

### Bug Fix - Card Image Display ✅
**Issue Resolved**: Card images not visible in card list
- **Problem**: Images were being saved correctly but only displayed in the card detail modal, not in the main card grid/list view
- **Solution**: 
  - Added image display to card grid view (shows as header image)
  - Added image thumbnails to list view (replaces category icon)
  - Properly handles cards with and without images
  - Images are now immediately visible after adding a card
- **Files Updated**: `App.tsx` (Dashboard component)
- **Status**: ✅ Complete - Images now display in all views

### Bug Fix - Content Security Policy Error ✅
**Issue Resolved**: CSP error when saving cards with images
- **Problem**: 
  - Error: "Refused to connect to 'data:image/...' because it violates Content Security Policy"
  - The `fetch()` API was being used to convert data URLs to Blobs, which is blocked by CSP
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented `dataURLToBlob()` helper function that converts data URLs without using fetch
  - Uses base64 decoding and Uint8Array to create Blobs directly
  - CSP-compliant method that works in all environments
- **Files Updated**: `driveStorage.ts`
- **Status**: ✅ Complete - Images now save without CSP errors

### TypeScript Build Errors Fixed ✅
**Issue Resolved**: Complete TypeScript compilation cleanup
- **Problem**: 47 TypeScript errors preventing build
- **Solution**: Comprehensive fix of all compilation issues:
  - ✅ Added missing `lucide-react` dependency
  - ✅ Created `vite-env.d.ts` for environment variable types
  - ✅ Fixed unused imports and variables throughout codebase
  - ✅ Fixed type mismatches (Blob vs File, interface property names)
  - ✅ Fixed readonly array issues in utility functions
  - ✅ Fixed Tesseract.js OCR configuration issues
  - ✅ Fixed component prop interface mismatches
  - ✅ Removed unused React imports (React 17+ JSX transform)
- **Files Updated**: 25+ files across components, services, and utils
- **Status**: ✅ Complete - Project now builds without TypeScript errors

### Bug Fix - Image Retrieval & CSP Compliance ✅
**Issue Resolved**: Cards with images failing to load with JSON parsing and CSP errors
- **Problem**: 
  - JSON parsing error: `"[object Object]" is not valid JSON` in `driveStorage.ts`
  - CSP violation: `drive://` protocol blocked by Content Security Policy
  - Images not displaying in card views
- **Solution**: 
  - ✅ Added `safeJSONParse()` function with proper error handling
  - ✅ Added `blobToDataURL()` helper for proper blob to data URL conversion
  - ✅ Enhanced `loadCardImageFromDrive()` with proper error handling and validation
  - ✅ Fixed image loading to convert `drive://` URLs to `data:` URLs (CSP compliant)
  - ✅ Added proper error handling for failed image loads
  - ✅ Improved encrypted image decryption workflow
- **Files Updated**: `driveStorage.ts`
- **Status**: ✅ Complete - Images now load correctly without CSP violations
- **Security**: Maintains zero-knowledge architecture with proper client-side decryption

### Bug Fix - Authentication Timing Issue ✅
**Issue Resolved**: Authentication successful but user stuck on landing page
- **Problem**: Auth state change listener was firing before access token was stored in sessionStorage
- **Root Cause**: Timing issue between Firebase auth state change and token storage completion
- **Solution**: 
  - Added waiting mechanism in auth state listener (waits up to 3 seconds for token)
  - Set user directly in AuthContext after successful sign-in (bypass timing issue)
  - Improved auth flow coordination between services and context
- **Result**: Users now properly transition to dashboard after successful authentication
- **Status**: ✅ Complete - Authentication flow timing resolved
- **Files Updated**: `src/services/auth.ts`, `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`

### Bug Fix - Drive Permission Verification Issue ✅
**Issue Resolved**: Users with granted Drive permissions being incorrectly rejected
- **Problem**: Firebase Auth `credential.scope` was returning empty array even when Drive permissions were granted
- **Root Cause**: Firebase Auth doesn't reliably return scope information in the credential object
- **Solution**: 
  - Made Drive API test the primary verification method (instead of scope checking)
  - Added fallback scope detection methods
  - Only reject users if actual Drive API access fails (not scope detection)
- **Result**: Users who grant Drive permissions will now be able to sign in successfully
- **Status**: ✅ Complete - Drive permission verification now works reliably
- **Files Updated**: `src/services/auth.ts`

### Bug Fix - Google OAuth Parameter Conflict ✅
**Issue Resolved**: Google sign-in error "Conflict params: approval_prompt and prompt"
- **Problem**: Used both deprecated `approval_prompt` and newer `prompt` parameters causing OAuth Error 400
- **Root Cause**: Google OAuth doesn't allow both parameters simultaneously
- **Solution**: Removed deprecated `approval_prompt: 'force'` parameter, keeping only `prompt: 'consent'`
- **Result**: Google sign-in now works properly while still forcing consent screen for Drive permissions
- **Status**: ✅ Complete - Authentication flow restored
- **Files Updated**: `src/services/auth.ts`
